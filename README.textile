h1. OVERVIEW

UnityREPL is a REPL (Read, Eval, Print, Loop) tool based on "Miguel's CSharpRepl":CSharpRepl but for "Unity":Unity.

What's a REPL?  See the "Wikipedia article.":Wikipedia or the "demo videos":Wiki on the Wiki.


h1. INSTALLATION

Please note that this requires UnityGUIExtensions.  The .unitypackage includes everything you need

h2. NON-GIT, OR UNITY-INDIE SETUP

* Grab the ".unitypackage":Package from the downloads page.
* Open your project.
* Click "Assets" -> "Import Package..." from the menu, and select the file.


h2. GIT SETUP IN A UNITY-PRO PROJECT THAT IS NOT VERSIONED WITH GIT

*You must have External Version Control enabled to use these instructions.  If not, please download the .unitypackage and use that.*

bc.   cd myproject/
  mkdir -p Assets/Editor/
  git clone git://github.com/MrJoy/UnityREPL.git Assets/Editor/UnityREPL
  git clone git://github.com/MrJoy/UnityGUIExtensions.git Assets/UnityGUIExtensions

By setting up this way, you can track updates using "git pull".


h2. GIT SETUP IN A UNITY-PRO PROJECT VERSIONED WITH GIT

*You must have External Version Control enabled to use these instructions.  If not, please download the .unitypackage and use that.*

bc.   cd myproject/
  mkdir -p Assets/Editor
  git submodule add git://github.com/MrJoy/UnityREPL.git Assets/Editor/UnityREPL

h1. USAGE

* Click "Window" -> "C# Shell"
* Dock the new tab wherever you wish, and enjoy!

From this window you can enter C# code and run it.  You should have access to all classes you've defined in C#, JavaScript, or Boo in your project.


h1. COMPATIBILITY

Tested on Unity 5.3.1, but should work on slightly earlier versions down to, perhaps 5.0.

Will definitely not work on older versions of Unity (4.x and below).

Full documentation is available from within UnityREPL by clicking the '?' button on the toolbar.

** Local vars getting blown away.
** Make sure we're not leaking references to things.
* Add things to UnityBaseClass to help with Unity workflows.
* Lots of other little things; see the source code for more info.
